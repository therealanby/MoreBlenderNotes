## Setting things up
- Nice add-on to have: auto mirror
- one cube

## Steps
- select mesh, press n(side bar), edit tab, auto mirror dropdown, select x and click auto mirror
- in edit mode, any changes in the mesh will be applied to the other side of the mesh across the y axis
- make a pelvis
- convert to torso by draggin face up
- add two loop cuts to split the torso into three
- create a small loop cut near the bottom segment (used for the legs)
- select bottom right edge and move it inwards
- e to extrude bottom face 
- scale the face
- r to rotate and make the face parallel to ground
- g to move the leg stumps
- extrude bottom face again to make legs all the way to the kneecap
- press g, z, and 0. This flattens the face to the z-axis I think
- extrude a small region twice for the knee. Twice for easier rigging. (two knee lines for bending is weird, three is better)
- extrude again for lower legs
- extrude again for ankle
- extrude from ankle twice for feet
- extra: create a loop cut, slide it to where you want the pant edge to be, scale it for pants leg effect
- upper right face on the side of the torso, select it
- extrude it a little for the arms
- scale down face
- move it up so it somewhat matches with shoulder(not totally in-line. Just lined up with shoulder in a slanty way like a real shoulder)
- extrude once for arms(should be a t-pose)
- scale down arm
- extrude twice for elbows
- extrude and scale for other arm segment
- extrude, scale up and extrude again for simple blocky hands
- 


## Hot keys
- 1 on numpad to get good side view for mirror modeling
- n for sidebar
- shift-space for quick menu of tools (g for grab, r for rotate, s for scale)

## Tips
- 2 units is a good size for a video game model
- for bending parts of the mesh for the rig, have three or more lines for better bending
