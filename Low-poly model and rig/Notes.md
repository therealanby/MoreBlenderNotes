## Setting things up
- Nice add-on to have: auto mirror
- one cube

## Steps
- select mesh, press n(side bar), edit tab, auto mirror dropdown, select x and click auto mirror
- in edit mode, any changes in the mesh will be applied to the other side of the mesh across the y axis
- make a pelvis
- convert to torso by draggin face up
- add two loop cuts to split the torso into three
- create a small loop cut near the bottom segment (used for the legs)
- select bottom right edge and move it inwards
- e to extrude bottom face 
- scale the face
- r to rotate and make the face parallel to ground
- g to move the leg stumps
- extrude bottom face again to make legs all the way to the kneecap
- press g, z, and 0. This flattens the face to the z-axis I think
- extrude a small region twice for the knee. Twice for easier rigging. (two knee lines for bending is weird, three is better)
- extrude again for lower legs
- extrude again for ankle
- extrude from ankle twice for feet
- extra: create a loop cut, slide it to where you want the pant edge to be, scale it for pants leg effect
- upper right face on the side of the torso, select it
- extrude it a little for the arms
- scale down face
- move it up so it somewhat matches with shoulder(not totally in-line. Just lined up with shoulder in a slanty way like a real shoulder)
- extrude once for arms(should be a t-pose)
- scale down arm
- extrude twice for elbows
- extrude and scale for other arm segment
- extrude, scale up and extrude again for simple blocky hands
- extrude from top of torso to start forming head
- scale and grab/slide inwards for neck base
- extrude for neck
- extrude and scale for head
- grab head outwards to make the base more square
- grab head out more for cartoon bighead
- extrude for rest of head
- loop cut with # of cuts at 2
- select edges at bottom and top of head to scale them down to make the head more detailed
- grab the faces inwards for rounder head shape
- edge select for more body detail
- select three chest edges. grab them out in a way to make a belly
- bring out side edge for waist
- arch the back and bring the back shoulders up
- belt: loop cut, scale out, loop cut below, scale out, scale/grab edges for additional detail, bring back that pointy vert at crotch
- loop select belt and extrude along normals
- head shrinking: box select in x-ray mode, scale down/up, and move down/up
- color: download palette provided by video (very small image to keep file size down)
- shading tab
- drag palette into node shader editor and connect to base color
- set interpolation from linear to closest
- go to UV editing workspace
- set viewport shading color to texture
- 'a' to view uv on palette texture and scale it down to zero. (a, s, 0)
- moving the dot to change color
- now you can select colors for faces
- 

## Hot keys
- 1 on numpad to get good side view for mirror modeling
- n for sidebar
- shift-space for quick menu of tools (g for grab, r for rotate, s for scale)
- alt-z for x-ray vision (useful for better view and selection of hidden things)
- alt-click (face mode) for loop select (selects a loop of faces)
- ctrl- + (numpad plus) for selection grow

## Tips
- 2 units is a good size for a video game model
- for bending parts of the mesh for the rig, have three or more lines for better bending
- enable clipping in mirror mod so there are no gaps at reflection point
- import palette as texture (node editor). Editing UV so that everything becomes a dot(scale to 0). Move dot around to select color. Select faces and moving the dot will change the face color
