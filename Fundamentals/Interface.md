Workspace
- you can create a new editor/window by right-clicking a border and selecting one of the splits
- you can join/merge editor/window by right-clicking and selecting join
- there are pre-made workspaces to improve workflow
- ctrl-space to maximize area of a window. ctrl-space again to unmaximize

Viewport
- press T to view general tools
- shift-space to view tools at cursor location
- press N to view object transformation data
- the 3D cursor is the spawn point of new objects and can be used for pivoting
- shift-s to quickly move 3D cursor somewhere
- timeline: playback of animation
- properties tab: properties of stuff
  - active tool
  - render (engine, sampling)
  - output (file save location, resolution, file type)
  - view layers (background and character pass separation)
  - scene (camera, gravity)
  - world (sky, air)
  - 
  - object (basic information about an object)
  - modifiers (manlipulation of object)
  - particles (particles...)
  - physics (how the object will interact with other objects in an animation)
  - object constraint (object relationship to other objects)
  - object data (mesh, geometry, ...)
  - material (shading, color)
  - 
  - texture (texture painting I assume. can apply to multiple things)
- other properties:
  - light (brightness)
  - camera (camera lens, other stuff)
- you can create multiple scenes with its own set of layers and stuff. It's basically like a new project but in a single project
- you can create multiple view layers. View layers are configurations of what objects/collections can be seen

Outliner
- lists all the objects in the current scene
- you can create collections to group objects together
- you can check and uncheck which objects/collections to show up in the viewpoint (and also render if you adjust the filter)
