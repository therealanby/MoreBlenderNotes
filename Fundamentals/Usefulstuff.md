Too lazy to create new files for each category.
Will document useful notes here. 

**UV Editing**
- uv editing workspace
- when you select a face in edit mode, it will only show that face on the uv editor
- in edit mode, there is an uv menu for unwrapping the mesh (useful ones are unwrap and smart uv project)
- there are different unwrapping algorithms useful for certain meshes
- you can mark seams as places to cut when unwrapping (mark seems in UV menu)

**Procedural Textures**
- textures that are generated using math
