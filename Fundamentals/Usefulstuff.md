Too lazy to create new files for each category.
Will document useful notes here. 

**UV Editing**
- uv editing workspace
- when you select a face in edit mode, it will only show that face on the uv editor
- in edit mode, there is an uv menu for unwrapping the mesh (useful ones are unwrap and smart uv project)
- there are different unwrapping algorithms useful for certain meshes
- you can mark seams as places to cut when unwrapping (mark seems in UV menu)

**Procedural Textures**
- textures that are generated using math

**Three point lighting**
- one of the best ways to light something
- three lights 
  - main/key light - defined light source (top-left corner usually)
  - fill light - softens shadows made by key light. the least bright. 
  - rim/back light - cast onto the back. brightest. gives object an outline
- spot light is good for this
- encase object with a cube to set up environment

**Render**
- render and viewport sampling: more accurate shading render
- lots of settings mess around with them in viewport shading
- tile settings (CPU rendering: 64 x 64; GPU rendering: 256 x 256)
